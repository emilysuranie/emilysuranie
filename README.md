<b>About Me:</b>

In May 2024, I graduated from Temple University with an English degree and a Professional Writing Certificate. During my years at Temple, I found my love for writing and my interest in the technological field, which led me to discover Technical Writing. Since then, I have grown a passion for creating concise, precise, and user-focused documents. Throughout my time at school, I worked at Saxbys as a Team Lead and Barista. This job has molded me into a diligent and dedicated individual, as I balanced my course load while working nearly every day. Last summer, I was presented the opportunity to work with Drive Engineering as a Proposal Writer Intern. This internship confirmed my desire to work in the tech industry. It taught me how to communicate with others in a professional environment, produce well-crafted documents while meeting deadlines, and navigate complex technical terms. I am currently seeking to use my skills and experiences to improve a companyâ€™s productivity within a professional setting.
