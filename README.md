<b>About Me:</b>

In May 2024, I graduated from Temple University with an English degree. During college, my love for writing flourished, along with my interest in technology. From this, I discovered technical writing and my passion for it developed quickly. This inspired me to attain a Professional Writing Certificate, which has transformed my writing to be precise, informative, and user-friendly. 

Since my sophomore year of college, I have worked as a Team Lead and Barista at Saxbys. Staying on top of my academic requirements while working part-time has forced me to manage my time wisely. This has made me a diligent worker and has helped build my communication and decision making skills. 

This past summer, I had the opportunity to work with Drive Engineering as a Proposal Writer Intern. This experience introduced me to writing in a professional setting, and confirmed my desire to work in a technical field. It taught me how to create structured documentation that follows the requirements of Federal project applications. This internship has furthered my communication skills as it required me to be in contact with colleagues from different teams. 

I am currently seeking to use my writing and communication skills to promote the productivity of a company in a professional environment.
