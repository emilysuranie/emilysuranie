<b>About Me:</b>

I am a recent English graduate with hands-on experience in professional writing and customer service. This past summer, I successfully completed an internship at Drive Engineering, gaining valuable skills in research, content creation, and project management. I've developed excellent communication abilities, attention to detail, and a passion for creating compelling narratives. By balancing part-time work with academic commitments, I have demonstrated a strong work ethic and time management skills through three years of experience as a team lead and barista. I am seeking to leverage my writing expertise and customer-focused experience in a professional environment.
